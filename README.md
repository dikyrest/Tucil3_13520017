# 15-puzzle

> Penyelesaian Persoalan 15-_Puzzle_ dengan Algoritma _Branch and Bound_

## **Description**
This is a small project created in order to fulfill the requirements of IF2211 Algorithm Strategy course in Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) Academic Year of 2021/2022. This project was created using Python and some of its built-in library. This project is a solution to the 15-puzzle problem (can be extended to n^2-puzzle). The goal of this project is to find a solution to the 15-puzzle using the Branch and Bound algorithm.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.9
- Library `tkinter`
```
pip install tkinter
```

## **Compiling**
Not necessary because Python is an interpreted language.

## **How to Use**
- open `src` folder in terminal and run this command
```
python main.py
```
- Enter file name in text box (ex. `solvable1.txt`), then click `solve` button
- If the puzzle is solvable, you'll see command (`Up, Down, Left, Right`) above the puzzle
- Follow the command by clicking the right tile (if command is `Up`, click the upside tile of empty tile)
- Those command will lead you to victory. So, enjoy the game!
Note: You can see available file in `test` folder
